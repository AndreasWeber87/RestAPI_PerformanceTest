This is an application for a performance test for REST APIs, which was developed as a part of my bachelor thesis. In my work, APIs with the languages [Go](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/RestAPI_Go), [Node.js](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/RestAPI_NodeJS) and [Python](https://github.com/AndreasWeber87/RestAPI_Python) were automatically tested and evaluated by this program.

The application provides the following functions:
- Selection of which API to test (the corresponding IP address and port is stored in the source code).
- Enter the number of data sets to be used for the test (the data itself is stored in the container).
- Enter the number of tasks to be used. The tasks send the HTTP requests to the API simultaneously.
- Automated execution of various performance tests and output of statistical data.
